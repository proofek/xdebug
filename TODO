For 1.2.0:

- Profiling
  * Add another profiling mode that allows for detailed function analysis.

For later:
- Update gdb debugging capabilities
  * watches / conditional breakpoints
- Additions
   * Provide codes for messages (for localization) including parameters
- Profiling
  * External data sources monitor
     create a hash-list of SQL & execution functions that can be 
     compared against the functions used in the code.
     If this external call takes > a certain pre-set time show the
     parameter passed to the function so that a person can optimize the
     query or the utility that is being called.
- Other
  * finish custom error handler support
  * namespaces support for Zend Engine 2
  * add trace code to trace which files/lines have been touched (to check
    code coverage).
