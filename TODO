- Bug fixing
  * Disconnect bug

- Profiling
  * External data sources monitor
     create a hash-list of SQL & execution functions that can be 
     compared against the functions used in the code.
     If this external call takes > a certain pre-set time show the
     parameter passed to the function so that a person can optimize the
     query or the utility that is being called.
