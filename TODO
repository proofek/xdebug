For 1.2.0:
- Update gdb debugging capabilities
  * accessing data
    o modifying variables
    o reading super globals
  * watches / conditional breakpoints
- Profiling
  * External data sources monitor
     create a hash-list of SQL & execution functions that can be 
     compared against the functions used in the code.
     If this external call takes > a certain pre-set time show the
     parameter passed to the function so that a person can optimize the
     query or the utility that is being called.
  * Auto-profile mode
     When enabled automatically generate backtraces and write them to
     the specified directory in [php_script]_[timestamp]_[pid].txt format.
     This will require 3 ini settings, auto_profile (bool), tmp_dir (string),
     profile_type (integer).
  * Separate profiling display
     Make it so that all sorting/collecting routines return a (nested) array
     with all data so that it can be used for remote handlers and other
     display methods.
