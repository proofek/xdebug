  <description>
The Xdebug extension helps you debugging your script by providing a lot of
valuable debug information. The debug information that Xdebug can provide
includes the following:

    * stack and function traces in error messages with:
          o full parameter display for user defined functions
          o function name, file name and line indications
          o support for member functions
    * memory allocation
    * protection for infinite recursions

Xdebug also provides:

    * profiling information for PHP scripts
    * code coverage analysis
    * capabilities to debug your scripts interactively with a debug client

Sat, Oct 20, 2007 - xdebug 2.0.1

+ Changes:
	- Improved code coverage performance dramatically.
	- PHP 5.3 compatibility (no namespaces yet though).

      <notes>
Wed, Jul 18, 2007 - xdebug 2.0.0

+ Changes:
	- Put back the disabling of stack traces - apperently people were relying
	  on this. This brings back xdebug_enable(), xdebug_disable() and
	  xdebug_is_enabled().
	- xdebug.collect_params is no longer a boolean setting. Although it worked
	  fine, phpinfo() showed only just On or Off here.
	- Fixed the Xdebug version of raw_url_encode to not encode : and \. This is
	  not necessary according to the RFCs and it makes debug breakpoints work
	  on Windows.

= Fixed bugs:
	- Fixed bug #291: Tests that use SPL do not skip when SPL is not available.
	- Fixed bug #290: Function calls leak memory.
	- Fixed bug #289: Xdebug terminates connection when eval() is run in the
	  init stage.
	- Fixed bug #284: Step_over on breakpointed line made Xdebug break twice.
	- Fixed bug #283: Xdebug always returns $this with the value of last stack
	  frame.
	- Fixed bug #282: %s is not usable for xdebug.profiler_output_name on
	  Windows in all stack frames.
	- Fixed bug #280: var_dump() doesn't display key of array as expected.
	- Fixed bug #278: Code Coverage Issue.
	- Fixed bug #273: Remote debugging: context_get does not return context id.
	- Fixed bug #270: Debugger aborts when PHP's eval() is encountered. 
	- Fixed bug #265: XDebug breaks error_get_last() .
	- Fixed bug #261: Code coverage issues by overloading zend_assign_dim.

+ DBGP:
	- Added support for "breakpoint_languages".

      <notes>
Wed, May 17, 2007 - xdebug 2.0.0rc4
+ Changes:
	- Use µ seconds instead of a tenths of µ seconds to avoid confusion in
	  profile information.
	- Changed xdebug.profiler_output_name and xdebug.trace_output_name to use
	  modifier tags:
	  %c = crc32 of the current working directory
	  %p = pid
	  %r = random number
	  %s = script name
	  %t = timestamp (seconds)
	  %u = timestamp (microseconds)
	  %H = $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']
	  %R = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']
	  %S = session_id (from $_COOKIE if set)
	  %% = literal %

= Fixed bugs:
	- Fixed bug #255: Call Stack Table doesn't show Location on Windows.
	- Fixed bug #251: Using the source command with an invalid filename returns
	  unexpected result.
	- Fixed bug #243: show_exception_trace="0" ignored.
	- Fixed bug #241: Crash in xdebug_get_function_stack().
	- Fixed bug #240: Crash with xdebug.remote_log on Windows.
	- Fixed a segfault in rendering stack traces to error logs.
	- Fixed a bug that prevented variable names from being recorded for remote
	  debug session while xdebug.collect_vars was turned off.
	- Fixed xdebug_dump_superglobals() in case no super globals were
	  configured.

- Removed functions:
	- Removed support for Memory profiling as that didn't work properly.
	- Get rid of xdebug.default_enable setting and associated functions:
	  xdebug_disable() and xdebug_enable().

+ Added features:
	- Implemented support for four different xdebug.collect_params settings for
	  stack traces and function traces.
	- Allow to trigger profiling by the XDEBUG_PROFILE cookie.

+ DBGP:
	- Correctly add namespace definitions to XML.
	- Added the xdebug namespace that adds extra information to breakpoints if
	  available.
	- Stopped the use of &gt;error> elements for exception breakpoints, as that
	  violates the protocol.

Wed, Jan 31, 2007 - xdebug 2.0.0rc3
+ Changes:
	- Removed the bogus "xdebug.allowed_clients" setting - it was not
	  implemented.
	- Optimized used variable collection by switching to a linked list instead
	  of a hash. This is about 30% faster, but it needed a quick conversion to
	  hash in the case the information had to be shown to remove duplicate
	  variable names.

= Fixed bugs:
	- Fixed bug #232: PHP log_errors functionality lost after enabling xdebug
	  error handler when CLI is used.
	- Fixed problems with opening files - the filename could cause double free
	  issues.
	- Fixed memory tracking as memory_limit is always enabled in PHP 5.2.1 and
	  later.
	- Fixed a segfault that occurred when creating printable stack traces and
	  collect_params was turned off.

Sun, Dec 24, 2006 - xdebug 2.0.0rc2
+ Added new features:
	- Implemented the "xdebug.var_display_max_children" setting. The default is
	  set to 128 children.
	- Added types to fancy var dumping function.
	- Implemented FR #210: Add a way to stop the debug session without having
	  to execute a script. The GET/POST parameter "XDEBUG_SESSION_STOP_NO_EXEC"
	  works in the same way as XDEBUG_SESSION_STOP, except that the script will
	  not be executed.
	- DBGP: Allow postmortem analysis.
	- DBGP: Added the non-standard function xcmd_profiler_name_get.

+ Changes:
	- Fixed the issue where xdebug_get_declared_vars() did not know about
	  variables there are in the declared function header, but were not used in
	  the code. Due to this change expected arguments that were not send to a
	  function will now show up as ??? in stack and function traces in PHP 5.1
	  and PHP 5.2.
	- Allow xdebug.var_display_max_data and xdebug.var_display_max_depth
	  settings of -1 which will unlimit those settings.
	- DBGP: Sort super globals in Globals overview.
	- DBGP: Fixed a bug where error messages where not added upon errors in the
	  protocol.
	- DBGP: Change context 1 from globals (superglobals + vars in bottom most
	  stack frame) to just superglobals.

= Fixed bugs:
	- Fixed linking error on AIX by adding libm.
	- Fixed dead code analysis for THROW.
	- Fixed oparray prefill caching for code coverage.
	- Fixed the xdebug.remote_log feature work.
	- DBGP: Fixed a bug where $this did not appear in the local scoped context.
	- DBGP: Reimplemented property_set to use the same symbol fetching function
	  as property_get. We now only use eval in case no type (-t) argument was
	  given.
	- DBGP: Fixed some issues with finding out the classname, which is
	  important for fetching private properties.
	- DBGP: Fixed usage of uninitialized memory that prevented looking up
	  numerical array keys while fetching array elements not work properly.
	- Fixed bug #228: Binary safety for stream output and property fetches.
	- Fixed bug #227: The SESSION super global does not show up in the Globals
	  scope.
	- Fixed bug #225: xdebug dumps core when protocol is GDB.
	- Fixed bug #224: Compile failure on Solaris.
	- Fixed bug #219: Memory usage delta in traces don't work on PHP 5.2.0.
	- Fixed bug #215: Cannot retrieve nested arrays when the array key is a
	  numeric index.
	- Fixed bug #214: The depth level of arrays was incorrectly checked so it
	  would show the first page of a level too deep as well.
	- Fixed bug #213: Dead code analysis doesn't take catches for throws into
	  account.
	- Fixed bug #211: When starting a new session with a different idekey, the
	  cookie is not updated.
	- Fixed bug #209: Additional remote debugging session started when
	  triggering shutdown function.
	- Fixed bug #208: Socket connection attempted when XDEBUG_SESSION_STOP.
	- Fixed PECL bug #8989: Compile error with PHP 5 and GCC 2.95.

      <version>2.0.0rc1</version>
      <date>2006-10-08</date>
      <notes>
+ Added new features:
    - Implemented FR #70: Provide optional depth on xdebug_call_* functions.
    - Partially implemented FR #50: Resource limiting for variable display. By
      default only two levels of nested variables and max string lengths of 512
      are shown. This can be changed by setting the ini settings
      xdebug.var_display_max_depth and xdebug.var_display_max_data.
    - Implemented breakpoints for different types of PHP errors. You can now
      set an 'exception' breakpoint on "Fatal error", "Warning", "Notice" etc.
      This is related to bug #187.
    - Added the xdebug_print_function_trace() function to display a stack trace on
      demand.
    - Reintroduce HTML tracing by adding a new tracing option "XDEBUG_TRACE_HTML"
      (4).
    - Made xdebug_stop_trace() return the trace file name, so that the
      following works: &lt;?php echo file_get_contents( xdebug_stop_trace() ); ?&gt;
    - Added the xdebug.collect_vars setting to tell Xdebug to collect
      information about which variables are used in a scope. Now you don't need
      to show variables with xdebug.show_local_vars anymore for
      xdebug_get_declared_vars() to work.
    - Make the filename parameter to the xdebug_start_trace() function
      optional. If left empty it will use the same algorithm to pick a filename
      as when you are using the xdebug.auto_trace setting.

+ Changes:
    - Implemented dead code analysis during code coverage for:
      * abstract methods.
      * dead code after return, throw and exit.
      * implicit returns when a normal return is present.
    - Improved readability of stack traces.
    - Use PG(html_errors) instead of checking whether we run with CLI when
      deciding when to use HTML messages or plain text messages.

= Fixed bugs:
    - Fixed bug #203: PHP errors with HTML content processed incorrectly. This
      patch backs out the change that was made to fix bug #182.
    - Fixed bug #198: Segfault when trying to use a non-existing debug handler.
    - Fixed bug #197: Race condition fixes created too many files.
    - Fixed bug #196: Profile timing on Windows does not work.
    - Fixed bug #195: CLI Error after debugging session.
    - Fixed bug #193: Compile problems with PHP 5.2.
    - Fixed bug #191: File/line breakpoints are case-sensitive on Windows.
    - Fixed bug #181: Xdebug doesn't handle uncaught exception output
      correctly.
    - Fixed bug #173: Coverage produces wrong coverage.
    - Fixed a typo that prevented the XDEBUG_CONFIG option "profiler_enable"
      from working.

      <notes>
  + Added new features:
      - Implemented FR #137: feature_get for general commands doesn't have a text field.
      - Implemented FR #131: XDebug needs to implement paged child object requests.
      - Implemented FR #124: Add backtrace dumping information when exception thrown.
      - Implemented FR #70: Add feature_get breakpoint_types.
      - Added profiling aggregation functions (patch by Andrei Zmievski)
      - Implemented the "timestamp" option for the xdebug.trace_output_name and
        xdebug.profiler_output_name settings.
      - Added the xdebug.remote_log setting that allows you to log debugger
        communication to a log file for debugging. This can also be set through
        the "remote_log" element in the XDEBUG_CONFIG environment variable.
      - Added a "script" value to the profiler_output_name option.  This will write
        the profiler output to a filename that consists of the script's full path
        (using underscores). ie: /var/www/index.php becomes
        var_www_index_php_cachegrind.out. (Patch by Brian Shire).
      - DBGp: Implemented support for hit conditions for breakpoints.
      - DBGp: Added support for conditions for file/line breakpoints.
      - DBGp: Added support for hit value checking to file/line breakpoints.
      - DBGp: Added support for "exception" breakpoints.

  + Performance improvements:
      - Added a cache that prevents the code coverage functionality from running a
        "which code is executable check" on every function call, even if they
        were executed multiple times. This should speed up code coverage a lot.
      - Speedup Xdebug but only gathering information about variables in scopes when
        either remote debugging is used, or show_local_vars is enabled.

      <notes>
+ Added new features:
    - DBGP: Added error messages to returned errors (in most cases)
  
+ Added new functions:
    - xdebug_debug_zval() to debug zvals by printing its refcounts and is_ref
      values.
  
= Changed features:
    - xdebug_code_coverage_stop() will now clean up the code coverage array,
      unless you specify FALSE as parameter.
    - The proper Xdebug type is "hash" for associative arrays.
    - Extended the code-coverage functionality by returning lines with
      executable code on them, but where not executed with a count value of -1.

= Fixed bugs:
    - DBGP: Make property_get and property_value finally work as they should,
      including retrieving information from different depths then the most top
      stack frame.
    - DBGP: Fix eval'ed $varnames in property_get.
    - DBGP: Support the -d option for property_get.
    - Fixed the exit handler hook to use the new "5.1" way of handling it;

     <state>beta</state>
     <version>2.0.0beta1</version>
     <date>2004-09-15</date>
     <notes>
+ Added new features:
    - Added support for the new DBGp protocol for communicating with the debug
      engine.
    - A computerized trace format for easier parsing by external programs.
    - The ability to set remote debugging features via the environment.  This
      allows an IDE to emulate CGI and still pass the configuration through to
      the debugger.  In CGI mode, PHP does not allow -d arguments.
    - Reimplementation of the tracing code, you can now only trace to file; this greatly
      enhances performance as no string representation of variables need to be
      kept in memory any more.
    - Re-implemented profiling support. Xdebug outputs information the same way
      that cachegrind does so it is possible to use Kcachegrind as front-end.
    - Xdebug emits warnings when it was not loaded as a Zend extension.
    - Added showing private, protected and public to the fancy var_dump()
      replacement function.
    - Added the setting of the TCP_NODELAY socket option to stop delays in
      transferring data to the remote debugger client. (Patch by Christof J.  Reetz)
    + DebugClient: Added setting for port to listen on and implemented running
      the previous command when pressing just enter.

+ Added new functions:
    - xdebug_get_stack_depth() to return the current stack depth level.
    - xdebug_get_tracefile_name() to retrieve the name of the tracefile. This
      is useful in case auto trace is enabled and you want to clean the trace
      file.
    - xdebug_peak_memory_usage() which returns the peak memory
      used in a script. (Only works when --enable-memory-limit was enabled)

+ Added feature requests:
    - FR #5: xdebug_break() function which interupts the script for the debug
      engine.
    - FR #30: Dump current scope information in stack traces on error.
    - FR #88: Make the url parameter XDEBUG_SESSION_START optional. So it can
      be disabled and the user does not need to add it.

+ Added new php.ini settings:
    - xdebug.auto_trace_file: to configure a trace file to write to as addition
      to the xdebug.auto_trace setting which just turns on tracing.
    - xdebug.collect_includes: separates collecting
      names of include files from the xdebug.collect_params setting.
    - xdebug.collect_return: showing return values in traces.
    - xdebug.dump_global: with which you can turn off dumping of super globals
      even in you have that configured.
    - xdebug.extended_info: turns off the generation of extended opcodes that
      are needed for stepping and breakpoints for the remote debugger. This is
      useful incase you want to profile memory usage as the generation of this
      extended info increases memory usage of oparrrays by about 33%. 
    - xdebug.profiler_output_dir: profiler output directory.
    - xdebug.profiler_enable: enable the profiler.
    - xdebug.show_local_vars: turn off the showing of local variables in the
      top most stack frame on errors.
    - xdebug.show_mem_delta: show differences between current and previous
      memory usage on a function call level.
    - xdebug.trace_options: to configure extra
      options for trace dumping:
        o XDEBUG_TRACE_APPEND option (1)

= Changed features:
    - xdebug_start_trace() now returns the filename of the tracefile (.xt is
      added to the requested name).
    - Changed default debugging protocol to dbgp instead of gdb.
    - Changed default debugger port from 17869 to 9000.
    - Changed trace file naming: xdebug.trace_output_dir is now used to
      configure a directory to dump automatic traces; the trace file name now
      also includes the pid (xdebug.trace_output_name=pid) or a crc32 checksum
      of the current working dir (xdebug.trace_output_name=crc32) and traces
      are not being appended to an existing file anymore, but simply
      overwritten.
    - Removed $this and $GLOBALS from showing variables in the local scope.

- Removed functions:
    - xdebug_get_function_trace/xdebug_dump_function_trace() because of the new
      idea of tracing.

= Fixed bugs:
    - Fixed bug #89: var_dump shows empty strings garbled.
    - Fixed bug #85: Xdebug segfaults when no idekey is set.
    - Fixed bug #83: More than 32 parameters functions make xdebug crash.
    - Fixed bug #75: xdebug's var_dump implementation is not binary safe.
    - Fixed bug #73: komodo beta 4.3.7 crash.
    - Fixed bug #72: breakpoint_get returns wrong structure.
    - Fixed bug #69: Integer overflow in cachegrind summary.
    - Fixed bug #67: Filenames in Xdebug break URI RFC with spaces.
    - Fixed bug #64: Missing include of xdebug_compat.h.
    - Fixed bug #57: Crash with overloading functions.
    - Fixed bug #54: source command did not except missing -f parameter.
    - Fixed bug #53: Feature get misusing the supported attribute.
    - Fixed bug #51: Only start a debug session if XDEBUG_SESSION_START is
      passed as GET or POST parameter, or the DBGP_COOKIE is send to the server.
      Passing XDEBUG_SESSION_STOP as GET/POST parameter will end the debug
      session and removes the cookie again. The cookie is also passed to the
      remote handler backends; for DBGp it is added to the &lt;init&gt; packet.
    - Fixed bug #49: Included file's names should not be stored by address.
    - Fixed bug #44: Script time-outs should be disabled when debugging.
    = Fixed bug #36: GDB handler using print causes segfault with wrong syntax
    - Fixed bug #33: Implemented the use of the ZEND_POST_DEACTIVATE hook. Now we
      can handle destructors safely too.
    - Fixed bug #32: Unusual dynamic variables cause xdebug to crash.

= Fixed bug with wrong file names for functions called from call_user_*().
  (Derick)
+ Added the option "dump_superglobals" to the remote debugger. If you set this
  option to 0 the "show-local" and similar commands will not return any data
  from superglobals anymore. (Derick)
= Fixed bug #2: "pear package" triggers a segfault. (Derick)
= Fixed crash bug when a function had sprintf style parameters (ie.
  strftime()). (Derick)
+ Added "id" attribute to &lt;var /&gt; elements in responses from the remove
  debugger when the response method is XML. This makes it possible to
  distinguish between unique elements by use of recursion for example. (Derick)
= Improved performance greatly by doing lazy folding of variables outside
  trace mode. (Derick)
= Fixed a bug with "quit", if it was used it disabled the extension for the
  current process. (Derick)
+ Added the "full" argument to the remote command "backtrace". When this
  argument is passed, the local variables will be returned to for each frame in
  the stack. (Derick)
+ Implemented xdebug_time_index() which returns the time passed since the
  start of the script. This change also changes the output of the tracing
  functions as the start time will no longer be the first function call, but
  the real start time of the script. (Derick)
+ Implemented the "show-local" command (shows all local variables in the
  current scope including all contents). (Derick)
+ Implemented conditions for breakpoints in the "break" command. (Derick)
