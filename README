XDEBUG
------

This extension is not totally finished yet, but it works fine for me. If
you have questions, feel free to send me an e-mail at derick@php.net. If
you like this piece of software, feel free to checkout my wishlist @
http://www.jdimedia.nl/derick/link.php?url=giftlist . Sending me items
from my wishlist improves my motivation to keep working on xdebug, and
helps me keeping xdebug free.

INSTALLATION
------------

You compile xdebug separately from the rest of PHP.  Note, however, that
you need access to the scripts "phpize" and "php-config".  If your
system does not have "phpize" and "php-config", you will need to compile
and install PHP from a source tarball first, as these script are
by-products of the PHP compilation and installation processes. It is
important that the source version matches the installed version as there
are slight, but important, differences between PHP versions. 

Once you have access to "phpize" and "php-config", do the following:

1. Unpack the tarball: tar -xzf xdebug-1.x.x.tgz.  Note that you do
not need to unpack the tarball inside the PHP source code tree.
Xdebug is compiled separately, all by itself, as stated above.

2. cd xdebug-1.x.x

3. Run phpize: phpize
   (or /path/to/phpize if phpize is not in your path).

4. ./configure --enable-xdebug (or: ../configure --enable-xdebug
   --with-php-config=/path/to/php-config if php-config is not in your
   path)

5. cp modules/xdebug.so /to/wherever/you/want/it

6. add the following line to php.ini:
   zend_extension="/wherever/you/put/it/xdebug.so"

7. Restart your webserver.

8. Write a PHP page that calls "phpinfo();" Load it in a browser and
   look for the info on the xdebug module.  If you see it, you have been
   successful!
